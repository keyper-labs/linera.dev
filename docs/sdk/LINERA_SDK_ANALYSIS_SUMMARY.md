##  Architecture Decision Summary

### 1. Dual Binary Model 
**Decision**: Separate Contract (write) and Service (read) Wasm binaries
**Impact**: Clear security model, efficient queries
**Trade-off**: More complex deployment

### 2. View System 
**Decision**: Key-value store abstraction with lazy loading
**Impact**: Efficient state management, scalable
**Trade-off**: Learning curve

### 3. Multi-Owner Chains 
**Decision**: Native multi-owner support with weighted consensus
**Impact**: Built-in multisig foundation
**Trade-off**: Complex configuration

### 4. Cross-Chain Messaging 
**Decision**: Asynchronous messaging with tracking
**Impact**: Secure cross-chain communication
**Trade-off**: Asynchronous (latency)

### 5. WebAssembly 
**Decision**: Wasm for smart contracts
**Impact**: Secure, portable, efficient
**Trade-off**: Limited system access
