## CRITICAL: Document Integrity Policy

### No Correction Trail in Repository

**All corrections must be seamless. The repository should appear perfect at all times.**

- ❌ NEVER create correction files (`*_CORRECTION*.md`, `*_ANALYSIS*.md`)
- ❌ NEVER leave versioned error history
- ❌ NEVER add "correction notes" or "errata"
- ✅ ALWAYS edit original files directly
- ✅ ALWAYS make docs appear as if always correct
- ✅ Use `.local-analysis/` (gitignored) for personal notes only

**The repo reflects final, correct state only.**
