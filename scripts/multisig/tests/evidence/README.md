## Test Runs

### February 4, 2026 - Conway Testnet Validation

**Location**: `validation-2026-02-04/`

**Purpose**: Validate multisig contract compilation and testnet deployment readiness.

**Files**:
- `chain_id.txt` - Chain ID generated during test
- `owners.txt` - Owner addresses used for testing
- `compile.log` - Wasm contract compilation output
- `wallet-init.log` - Complete wallet initialization log

**Test Configuration**:
- Testnet: Conway (https://faucet.conway.linera.net)
- Compiler: Rust 1.87.0
- Target: wasm32-unknown-unknown
- Contract: Safe Multisig Standard (8 operations)

**Results**:
- ✅ Compilation: Successful
- ✅ Unit Tests: 74/74 passing
- ❌ Deployment: BLOCKED (Wasm Opcode 252 issue)

**Key Findings**:
1. Contract compiles successfully with 222 `memory.copy` opcodes
2. All 74 unit tests passing (0 warnings)
3. Deployment blocked by Linera runtime not supporting opcode 252

**Critical Issue**: See [LINERA_OPCODE_252_ISSUE.md](../../../../docs/research/LINERA_OPCODE_252_ISSUE.md) for details.

## Test Procedure

The validation evidence is generated by:

```bash
./scripts/multisig/validate-multisig-complete.sh
```

This script:
1. Compiles the multisig contract to Wasm
2. Runs all unit tests
3. Initializes wallet on Conway testnet
4. Validates contract state
5. Generates evidence files

## Cleanup

To clean old test evidence (older than 30 days):

```bash
find scripts/multisig/tests/evidence/ -type d -mtime +30 -exec rm -rf {} +
```
